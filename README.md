# Rotating Cube in Java with Swing and in QT with C++

## Project Description

This project serves as a foundational tool for understanding  basics of computational 3D Geometry and implementing GUI 
applications using Java Swing and Qt with C++.

## Features

- **Rotating Cube with Swing in Java**: Perform rotation of a wired cube.
- [Rotating Cube with Swing in Java](https://github.com/AdolfCarr/QT_Calculator/blob/main/findAllHobbits/findAllHobbits_structuredBinding.cpp): Initially considered but not used due to compilation issues caused by the structured binding syntax, which requires C++17 support.
